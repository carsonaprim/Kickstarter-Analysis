# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
Analyzing Kickstarter data to assist in the decision making process by looking at past projects and their varying levels of success

Starting out it is necessary to take a wide lens look at our data, and see what levels of success each type of Kickstarter has and how Louise's preference sizes up.
The Overall Success of the theater category shows that there is already a frame in place for the type of Kickstarter campaign that Louise is interested in.
The next step is to specifically look at the success of plays in the US, as well as plays in GB since that is an overlap of interest for Louise, and seeing the overarching successes, a style of play suited for GB in the US would be a fair overlap for Louise.
Down to the numbers, looking at successful and failed goals for plays in the US, we can give suggested guidelines for the goal that Louise should set for her Kickstarter given her goals and interests.
